  bio: `Remember that tall guy? Yeah that's me.

Yo! I am Aviral Malhotra, better known in some circles as Aloo or Laddoo (No, I won't explain. No, it doesn't make sense. Yes, it stuck).

I'm currently studying Computer Science at IIIT Hyderabad and spend most of my time (when I'm awake) trying to make my code behave or wondering why bugs appear five minutes before deadlines. I live for that "It finally works!" moment even if it means sacrificing my sanity.

I love building things and have worked on various projects ranging from solo-building an e-commerce platform to leading a team to digitalize administration for my institute.

When I'm not buried in code, I'm usually jamming on my guitar, snapping photos on my phone, winning big (or getting wrecked) in gaming marathons, occasionally cooking something yummy (emphasis on occasionally), or going down rabbit holes exploring new tech.

That's prettty much me: part developer, part musician, part chaos with a keyboard. If you're into building cool things, geeking out, sharing memes, or just want to know which dish matches your variable naming style- hit me up!`,
